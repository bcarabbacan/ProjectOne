            </a>
        <p>I absolutely loved the soundtrack and the story. The first Pokémon game I 
    
            played starting my marathon of Pokémon games near the end of 2024.

        </a>        
        <p>This provided a different way of playing Pokémon and the new way of catching 
        
            Pokémon was addicting. I also enjoyed the increased availability of shiny 
         
            Pokémon and the difficulty.</p>

            </a>
        <p>This was very good. It added quality of life updates from White/Black and it 
          
            was a direct sequel. I just prefered the story and Team Plasma soundtrack on 
           
            the first one more.</p>

            <p>My most recent, I enjoyed playing through the story and I liked the 
               
                increased personalization of your character. Just the options were 
            
                dissapointing for me, the male protagonist specifically. The graphics
             
                were also nice.

        <p> My first Nintendo Switch Pokémon game. My friend's brother let me borrow his 
           
            copy! I also got my first full odds shiny here!</p>

    <article>
    <a href="https://www.popmart.com/us/products/1695/kubo-24-7-you-series-figures">
          <li>Kubo x Pop Mart Figures
          </li>
          <img src="../img/kubo.png" alt="a bunch of popmart kubo figurines lined up behind a kubo 24/7 you box">
          </a>
          </a>
    <p>I think the character itself is very cool and it has different designs you are able 
    
        to collect.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
   <a href="https://us.jellycat.com"><li>Plushies</li>
    <img src="../img/plushies.png" alt="a bunch of plushies. a bear, an avocado, two chicken littles and a rowlet pokemon">
    </a>
    <p>I just ended up with a lot of plushies that I have accumlated through a variety of
         ways. </p>
         </article>
         <article>
    <a href="https://funko.com">
    <li>Funko Pops!</li>
    <img src="../img/funko.png" alt=" six funko pop boxes stacked. Pain, Stitch, Spider-Man
    Troy, Hello Kitty, and Ken">
</a>
    <p> The selection of figures you can get are amazing and you are able to get whatever 
       
        your favorite characters are from movies, shows, games, etc. Each Funko Pop I have
     
        has a story attached to it.

        <li>Pokemon Games/Cards</li>
        <img src="../img/pokemon.png" alt="a bunch of pokemon games and a pokémon card">
        </a>
    <p> I enjoy playing pokemon and I find the concept of pokemon very fun. I also collected
    
         pokemon cards growing up but as a kid, I didn't realize a lot of the ones I had 
  
         were fake.</p>

    <li>Fitted Hats</li>
    <img src="../img/hats.png" alt="a bunch of hats. a gray/brown giants hat, a navy Fear of God hat,
    a green yankees hat, a brown/beige rockies hat, and a blue/pink cardinals hat">
    </a>
    <p>I got into hats when I bought a hat that I seen on social media. I then continued 
    
        to buy hats when I wanted to hide my head. I went bald as a punishment for 
     
        leading the team in strikeouts (it was my first year ever playing baseball).
