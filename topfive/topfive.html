            </a>
        <p>I absolutely loved the soundtrack and the story. The first Pokémon game I 
    
            played starting my marathon of pokemon games I played near the end of 2024.

            <li>Legends: Arceus</li>
        </a>        
        <p>This provided a different way of playing pokemon and the new way of catching 
        
            pokémon was addicting. I also enjoyed the increased availability of shiny 
         
            pokémon and the difficulty.</p>

            <li>Black 2</li>
            </a>
        <p>This was very good. It added quality of life updates from White/Black and it 
          
            was a direct sequel. I just prefered the story and Team Plasma soundtrack on 
           
            the first one more.</p>

            <li>Sword</li>
            <p>My most recent, I enjoyed playing through the story and I liked the 
               
                increased personalization of your character. Just the options were 
            
                dissapointing for me, the male protagonist specifically. The graphics
             
                were also nice.

            </a>
        <p> My first Nintendo Switch Pokémon game. My friend's brother let me borrow his 
           
            copy! I also got my first full odds shiny here!</p>

          </a>
    <p>I think the character itself is very cool and it has different designs you are able 
    
        to collect.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
   <a href="https://us.jellycat.com"><li>Plushies</li>
    </a>
    <p>I just ended up with a lot of plushies that I have accumlated through a variety of
  
         ways. I also linked jellycat as it is a popular brand for plushies> I don't 
       
         personally own any but I did not know what else to link</p>

    <a href="https://funko.com">
    <li>Funko Pops!</li>
</a>
    <p> The selection of figures you can get are amazing and you are able to get whatever 
       
        your favorite characters are from movies, shows, games, etc. Each Funko Pop I have
     
        has a story attached to it.

        <li>Pokemon Games/Cards</li>
        </a>
    <p> I enjoy playing pokemon and I find the concept of pokemon very fun. I also collected
    
         pokemon cards growing up but as a kid, I didn't realize a lot of the ones I had 
  
         were fake.</p>

    <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/item-shop?lang=en-US">
    <li>Fitted Hats</li>
    </a>
    <p>I got into hats when I bought a hat that I seen on social media. I then continued 
    
        to buy hats when I had shorter hair to hide. I went bald as a punishment for 
     
        leading the team in strikeouts (it was my first year ever playing baseball).
