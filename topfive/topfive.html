     <h2> Top Five of the most Recent Pokemon Games I've Played</h2>
     <ol>
        <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-black-version-and-pokemon-white-version">
            <li>Pokemon White</li>
            </a>
           <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU-dijvIo-w"> 
            <img src="img/pokemonwhite.jpg" alt="Pokemon trainer in front of the two legendary Pokemon Reshiram 
            and Zekrom in between the two pokemon is the antagonist N in a room on a square patterned platform.">
            </a>
        <p>I absolutely loved the soundtrack and the story.</p>
        <a href="https://legends.arceus.pokemon.com/en-us/"> 
            <li>Pokemon Legends: Arceus</li>
        </a>        
        <p>This provided a different way of playing pokemon and the new way of catching pokemon was addicting. 
            I also enjoyed the increased availability of shiny pokemon and the difficulty.</p>
        <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-black-version-2-and-pokemon-white-version-2">
            <li>Pokemon Black 2</li>
            </a>
        <p>Was very good just prefered the story and Team Plasma soundtrack on the first one more.</p>
        <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-heartgold-and-soulsilver-versions">
            <li>Pokemon Soul Silver</li>
            </a>
        <p>The level scaling in this game has me training my Pokemon too much dissalowing me to progress in the story.
             But, I am still not done with the game yet so this might change.</p>
        <a href="https://diamondpearl.pokemon.com/en-us/">
            <li>Pokemon Shining Pearl</li>
            </a>
        <p> 4 and 5 are interchangeable. I enjoyed the difficulty of the Elite Four but, the main story was too easy.</p>
     </ol>

<h2>List of things I like to collect</h2>
     <ul>
    
    <a href="https://www.popmart.com/us/products/1695/kubo-24-7-you-series-figures">
          <li>Kubo x Pop Mart Figurines</li>
          </a>
          <a href="https://www.popmart.co.jp/?pid=181923427">
            <img src="img/kubo.jpg" alt="kubo mvp figurine with blonde hair in a basketball jersey on a streetball court with a basketball hoop in the background">
          </a>
    <p>I think the character itself is very cool and it has different designs you are able to collect.</p>
   <a href="https://us.jellycat.com"><li>Plushies</li>
    </a>
    <p>I just ended up with a lot of plushies that I have accumlated through a variety of ways. I also linked jellycat as it is a popular brand for plushies> I don't personally own any but I did not know what else to link</p>
    <a href="https://funko.com">
    <li>Funko Pops!</li>
</a>
    <p> The selection of figures you can get are amazing and you are able to get whatever your favorite characters are from movies, shows, games, etc. </p>
    
    <a href="https://tcg.pokemon.com/en-us/">
        <li>Pokemon Games/Cards</li>
        </a>
    <p> I enjoy playing pokemon and I find the concept of pokemon very fun. I also collected pokemon cards growing up but as a kid, I didn't realize a lot of the ones I had were fake.</p>
    <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/item-shop?lang=en-US">
    <li>Fortnite Costmetics</li>
    </a>
    <p>This last one I had trouble coming up with but considering I spent a decent amount of money on this game, means it is on the list. I also like to check what is on the shop daily to see
         if I should get anything with my leftover virual currency.</p>
</ul>
