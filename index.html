        <h1 id="greeting"> Hi! I'm Bryan Carabbacan. A Visual Communication Design Student 
            at SFSU.</h1>
            <p> I first got into design when I was placed in a Digital Media Arts class.
                <br>
                 It was one of the electives that they had us cycle through every quarter 
                 <br>
                 of the school year. I fell in love with low-poly art and how satsifying 
                 <br>
                 it was to see the end result. I eventually followed my interest in design 
                 <br>
                 all the way through high school when I choose  the Arts, Media, and 
                 <br>
                 Entertainment (AME) Academy as my pathway. When applying for college, I 
                 <br>
                 ended up with Kinesiolgy as the major I would apply to schools with. But
                 <br> 
                 after some rethinking, I changed majors and now I am here!
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 In my free time, I like to play video games. When I had to get surgery on 
                 <br>
                 my knee, I was stuck in bed and I spent a lot of my time playing on my
                 <br>
                Nintendo Switch that I got a couple of days before the procedure. I also 
                <br>
                grew up playing video games. Whether it was alone or with friends, I use 
                <br>
                video games as a way to bond with people. I find it easier to connect with
                <br>
                people when we are working together or competing against each other.
              <br>
              <br>
              Growing up I have always played sports and I really enjoy watching 
              <br>
              it with my family. Baksetball was the sport I played the most of my years 
              <br>
              growing up. I also played Baseball and some Soccer. 
              <br>
              <br>
                Another fun fact about me is I love dogs. Growing up, my uncle had pets 
                <br>
                around the house and he would have them play in the backyard at the same 
                <br>
                time, I would be playing basketball there. They would run toward me and 
                <br>
                jump at me. Knowing now they had no intentions of trying to harm me, I did
                <br>
                not know that and I was terrified everytime they did so. Now I love dogs
                <br> 
                and desire to have one at some point in the future. I also enjoy making
                <br> 
                people laugh. I like to mess around with friends and try to have a positive
                <br> 
                vibe when I can.
