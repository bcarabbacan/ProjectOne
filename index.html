        <p>I am a Visual Communication Design student at SFSU.
             I first got into design when I took a digital media arts class my first year in middle school. 
             I enventually followed that intrest all the way through high school.
              When applying for college, I decided to put that aside and focus on my love for sports. 
              So I decided to major in Kinesiology. But, that backfired and now I am here!

              I enjoy making people smile and laugh! But, I will admit I am very shy so I would have to get to know you first.
              I like to play video games in my free time. I also do a little bit of photography but it is more for memory capturing. Growing up I have always played sports and really enjoy watching it.
              I love watching Baseball, Basketball, and Football. Another fun fact about me is I love dogs. This is crazy to me because I was terrified when my uncle's dogs would run toward me. I also love birds and enjoy watching funny videos of them on instagram.
