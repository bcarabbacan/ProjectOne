        <h1 id="greeting"> Hi! My name is Bryan Carabbacan and I am a Visual
             Communication Design Student at SFSU.</h1>
            <p> I first got into design when I was placed in a Digital Media 
                <br>
                Arts class. It was one of the electives that they had us cycle
                <br>
                through every quarter of the school year. I fell in love with 
                <br>
                 low-poly art and how satsifying it was to see the end result.
                 <br>
                 I eventually followed my interest in design all the way through
                 <br>
                high school when I choose  the Arts, Media, and Entertainment 
                <br>
                (AME) Academy as my pathway. When applying for college, I ended
                <br>
                up with Kinesiolgy as the major I would apply to schools with.
                <br>
                 But after some rethinking, I changed majors and now I am here!
                 <br>
                 <br>
              In my free time, I like to play video games. When I had to get 
              <br>
              surgery on my knee, I was stuck in bed and I spent a lot of my 
              <br>
              time playing on my Nintendo Switch that I got a couple of days 
              <br>
              before the procedure.
              <br>
              <br>
              Growing up I have always played sports and I really enjoy watching 
              <br>
              it with my family. Another fun fact about me is I love dogs. This 
              <br>
              is crazy to me because I was terrified when my uncle's dogs would
              <br>
            run toward me. I also love birds and enjoy watching funny videos of 
            <br>
            them on Instagram.
