        <h3> I am a Visual Communication Design student at San Francisco State University.</h3>
            <h4>I first got into design when I took a digital media arts class my first year in middle school. 
                <br>
             I eventually followed that intrest all the way through high school. </h4>
        
            <p>
              I enjoy making people smile and laugh! But, at the same time I am very shy.
              <br>
              I like to play video games in my free time. I also do a little bit of photography
              <br>
               but it is more for memory capturing. Growing up I have always played sports and really enjoy watching it.
              I love watching Baseball, Basketball, and Football. Another fun fact about me is I love dogs. This is crazy to me because I was terrified when my uncle's dogs would run toward me. I also love birds and enjoy watching funny videos of them on instagram.
