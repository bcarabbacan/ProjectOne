<p> Seso is an Art Director with a YouTube channel dedicated to graphic design
    content. Watching his videos on design helps me think about designs as he 
    critiques others who are getting into graphic design. His videos redesigning
     other projects are entertaining to me as his changes help elevate a design 
     and he explains his design decisions and why his changes work better for 
     what the original designer might be looking to achieve. He also has a bunch
      of tutorials for others to learn about graphic design tricks.  </p>

        <p>Lex Play is an island designer in a game called <em> Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</em></p>
        <h3>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</h3> 

<p>This is a game that inspires me because of the amount of creativity the community produces.
This game was designed as chores for people to complete daily and interact with animals who stay with you on an island. 
You are in charge of this island and can alter the island and design the island to your liking. 
Seeing what the community can create is mind boggling to me and makes me want to do the same. 
But, it is also difficult to do because it takes time. But seeing the creative designs of others just wows me. </p>

<p>Will Patterson is a logo designer that has inspired me in the past.
 I am particularly drawn to designers redesigning other peoples design.
  In a way it is designing in a way that is educational to me. 
  Fixing beginners mistakes and why this other way might be better for the design.
    Will Patterson is one of the first designers I watched where I gained more interest in design.</p>
