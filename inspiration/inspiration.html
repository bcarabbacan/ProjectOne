<p> Seso is a graphic designer for the esports team "100 Thieves." 
    Watching his videos on my design helps me think about designs as he critiques others who are getting into graphic design. 
    His videos redesigning other projects are entertaining to me as his changes
    help elevate a design and he explains his design decisions and why his changes work better
      for what the original designer might be looking to achieve. 
    He also has a bunch of tutorials for others to learn about graphic design tricks.  </p>

<h3>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</h3> 

<p>This is a game that inspires me because of the amount of creativity the community produces.
This game was designed as chores for people to complete daily and interact with animals who stay with you on an island. 
You are in charge of this island and can alter the island and design the island to your liking. 
Seeing what the community can create is mind boggling to me and makes me want to do the same. 
But, it is also difficult to do because it takes time. But seeing the creative designs of others just wows me. </p>

<p>Will Patterson is a logo designer that has inspired me in the past.
 I am particularly drawn to designers redesigning other peoples design.
  In a way it is designing in a way that is educational to me. 
  Fixing beginners mistakes and why this other way might be better for the design.
    Will Patterson is one of the first designers I watched where I gained more interest in design.</p>
