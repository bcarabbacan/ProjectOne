<p> Seso is an Art Director with a YouTube channel dedicated to graphic design
    <br>
    content. Watching his videos on design helps me think about designs as he 
    <br>
    critiques others who are getting into graphic design. His videos redesigning
    <br>
     other projects are entertaining to me as his changes help elevate a design 
     <br>
     and he explains his design decisions and why his changes work better for 
     <br>
     what the original designer might be looking to achieve. He also has a bunch
     <br>
      of tutorials for others to learn about graphic design tricks.  </p>

        <p>Lex Play is an island designer in a game called <em> Animal Crossing New Horizons.</em></p>
        <!-- <h3>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</h3>  -->

<p>This is a game that inspires me because of the amount of creativity the
    <br>
community produces. This game was designed as chores for people to complete 
<br>
daily and interact with animals who stay with you on an island. You are in 
<br>
charge of this island and can alter the island and design the island to your 
<br>
liking. Seeing what the community can create is mind boggling to me and makes me
<br> 
want to do the same. But, it is also difficult to do because it takes time. But 
<br>
seeing the creative designs of others just wows me. </p>

<p>Will Patterson is a logo designer that has inspired me in the past. I am 
    <br>
particularly drawn to designers redesigning other peoples design. In a way it is
<br>
designing in a way that is educational to me. Fixing beginners mistakes and why
<br>
this other way might be better for the design. Will Patterson is one of the 
<br>
first designers I watched where I gained more interest in design.</p>
